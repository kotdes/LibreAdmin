# LibreAdmin
LibreAdmin is an open source administration tool, for experiments to happen.

## What really is this?
At the moment, no source code is hosted in this repository, this is because:
- It is still under development
- We don't think it is ready to be released yet
- It's not functional enough to be considered as a tool yet

Stay tuned for more.
